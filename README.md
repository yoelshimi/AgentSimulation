 agent based simulation of covid outbreak on a network society modeled on a town


Models for epidemic spread typically account for variable risk factors but do not account for the correlation between behavior and risk. Here we extend these models to account for such correlations. We find that a positive correlation between behavior and risk, i.e., voluntary risk aversion by individuals at high risk and risk-taking behavior by individuals at low risk, leads to a linear reduction in morbidity and mortality and load on healthcare services compared to the uncorrelated case. We show that increasing caution in response to news from countries with a preceding outbreak leads to a more graded response to a lock-down. We also show that if vaccinated individuals are less cautious an increase in herd immunity threshold ensues.
